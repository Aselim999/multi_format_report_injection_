  "content": "User Model Analysis\nOverview\nThe User  model is a core model in the Blog API application, representing registered\nusers who can create posts and comments. It inherits from ApplicationRecord  and\nimplements authentication, validations, and relationships with other models.\nKey Implementation Details\nAuthentication\nhas_secure_password\nUses Rails' has_secure_password  method to handle password hashing and\nauthentication\nThis adds methods for password validation and the authenticate  method used in\nthe AuthController\nRequires the bcrypt gem for secure password hashing\nValidations\nvalidates :email ,presence :true ,uniqueness :true\nvalidates :name ,presence :true\nValidates that email is present and unique across all users\nValidates that name is present\nThese validations ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate accounts\nRelationships\nhas_many :posts ,dependent ::destroy\nhas_many :comments ,dependent ::destroy\nA user can have many posts (one-to-many relationship)\nA user can have many comments (one-to-many relationship)\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nThe dependent: :destroy  option ensures that when a user is deleted, all their posts\nand comments are automatically deleted as well (cascading delete)\nDatabase Schema Implications\nBased on the model definition, we can infer that the users table likely has the following\ncolumns: - id (primary key) - name  (string, required) - email  (string, required, unique)\n- password_digest  (string, required for has_secure_password) - created_at  (datetime) -\nupdated_at  (datetime) - Possibly an image  field (based on the user_params in\nAuthController)\nSecurity Considerations\nPasswords are securely hashed using bcrypt (via has_secure_password)\nEmail uniqueness prevents duplicate accounts\nThe model doesn't store plain text passwords\nImplementation Notes\nThe model follows Rails conventions\nThe dependent destroy option ensures data integrity by preventing orphaned\nrecords\nThe model is relatively simple but implements all necessary functionality for user\nauthentication and relationships\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 ",
